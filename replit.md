# Overview

This is a Personal Finance PWA (Progressive Web App) called "Finan√ßas Semanais" - a local-first weekly financial management application. The app helps users track income, expenses, and weekly goals with a premium design interface. All data is stored locally using IndexedDB with encryption capabilities, ensuring complete privacy and offline functionality.

The application features a dashboard with weekly progress tracking, transaction management, category organization, reporting capabilities, and data backup/restore functionality. It's built as a PWA to be installable and work offline while maintaining a modern, responsive design inspired by premium financial applications.
